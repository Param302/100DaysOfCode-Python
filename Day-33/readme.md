## Task
1. Titanic dataset prediction challenge
2. Data Science project challenge in GHW

# Resources
- Kaggle [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/)
- - [My Notebook 1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/param302/titanic-survival-competition-6)
- - [My Notebook 2](https://www.kaggle.com/code/param302/titanic-survival-competition-7)

- - [Create an Animation](https://github.com/Param302/MLH-GHW-2023/tree/master/Day-4%20CSS)

### Topics I have learnt
1. Titanic dataset prediction
- With `XGBClassifier` and did `Feature Engineering` using Mutual Information and by creating new features.
- Same as above but used less features.

1. Also participated in MLH Global Hack Week INIT 2023 [ðŸ”—](https://ghw.mlh.io/)
- Did 1 challenge created An Aquarium animation
