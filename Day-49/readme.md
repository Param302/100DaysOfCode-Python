# Day 43 of [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/Param3021/status/1548964394042011648)
I have created a repository having all my notes and codes of Machine learning specialization course. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

## Task
1. Code for Linear / Polynomial regression in Python.

## Resources
- Machine Learning Specialization Course [ðŸ”—](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
- - Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification [ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### Topics I have learnt
1. Linear regression code in Python

### My notebooks
- All of my notes of this course are in my ML speicalization notes repository. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

### Conclusion:
Today I wrote code for Multiple Linear Regression including it's cost function and gradient descent. 
Took so much time, but worked successfully! 
Also did some feature engineering and feature scaling with data.
Not did Polynomial regression code.
