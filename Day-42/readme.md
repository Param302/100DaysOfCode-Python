# Day 42 of [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/Param3021/status/1548595765290754048)
I have created a repository having all my notes and codes of Machine learning specialization course. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

## Task
1. Gradient Descent in ML

## Resources
- Machine Learning Specialization Course [ðŸ”—](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
- - Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification [ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### Topics I have learnt
1. Gradient Descent
- Algorithm
- Working of Gradient Descent
- How *derivative* and *learning rate* effects *coefficients*
- How *derivatives* are calculated
- Gradient Descent in Action

### Software used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.10.2

### My notebooks
- All of my notes of this course are in my ML speicalization notes repository. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

### Conclusion:
Finally!, Today I completed Week 1 of Superivsed Machine Learning course. Today I learned about Batch Gradient Descent algorithm in Linear Regression.
