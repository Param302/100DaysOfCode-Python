# Day 37 of [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/Param3021/status/1546790848788336640)
I have created a repository having all my notes and codes of Machine learning specialization course. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

## Task
1. Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
2. Regression model (not started)

## Resources
- Machine Learning Specialization Course [ðŸ”—](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
- - Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification [ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### Topics I have learnt
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Regression
4. Classification
5. Clustering
6. Practice quiz on Supervised vs Unsupervised learning

### Software used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.10.2

### My notebooks
- All of my notes of this course are in my ML speicalization notes repository. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

### Conclusion:
Today I have learned about Supervised and Unsupervised learning in ML. Also, definition of Regression, Classification and clustering. And I have made a repository having all my notes and codes of Machine Learning specialization course.
