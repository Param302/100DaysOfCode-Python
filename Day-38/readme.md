I have created a repository having all my notes and codes of Machine learning specialization course. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

## Task
1. Regression model in ML course
2. Mathematics for ML book   (not done)

## Resources
- Machine Learning Specialization Course [ðŸ”—](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
- - Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification [ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### Topics I have learnt
1. Regression model in ML course (definitions)
- Linear Regression model
- Notations in Machine learning

### Software used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.10.2

### My notebooks
- All of my notes of this course are in my ML speicalization notes repository. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

### Conclusion:
Today I have learned about Linear Regression model and some notations in machine learning. Not did much today.
