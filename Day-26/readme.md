## Task
1. Feature Engineering Course
2. House price prediction       (not done)

# Resources
- Kaggle's [Feature Engineering Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)
- - Lesson 3: [Creating Features](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/creating-features) - [My Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/param302/exercise-creating-features/)

### Topics I have learnt
1. Feature Engineering
- Creating Features
- - creating new features 

### Software used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.10.2
- Numpy 1.22.4
- pandas 1.4.2
- Matplotlib 3.5.2
- Seaborn 0.11.2
- scikit-learn 1.1.1
- XGBoost 1.6.1

### My Notebooks
- [L3 - Creating_features.ipynb](./L3%20-%20Creating_features.ipynb)

### Conclusion:
Today I learned how to create new features based on old features which helps our model like creating ratios, count features, splitting features into different sub-features, also grouped transformers. Not did house price prediction.
