- Made a [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/ltYkbAh_8FU) on [Wikipedia Searcher App](https://github.com/AnantLuthra/wikipedia_searcher) with [Anant Luthra](https://github.com/AnantLuthra)


### Conclusion:
Today I learned about more parameters in Decision Trees Regressor / Classifier. Didn't revised maths. Also, Made a [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/ltYkbAh_8FU) with with [Anant Luthra](https://github.com/AnantLuthra) on on [Wikipedia Searcher App](https://github.com/AnantLuthra/wikipedia_searcher) for Global Hack week hackathon.
