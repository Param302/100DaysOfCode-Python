### Topics I have learnt
1. Intro to Machine Learning Course
- How Models Work
- Exploring data
- Decision Trees (DecisionTreeRegressor)
- Random Forest (RandomForestRegressor)
- Overfitting and Underfitting data
- Model Validation using MAE (mean absolute error)
1. Also did house price prediction

### Software used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.10.2
- Numpy 1.22.4
- pandas 1.4.2
- scikit-learn 1.1.1

### My Notebooks
- [L2 - Explore_your_data.ipynb](./L2%20-%20Explore_your_data.ipynb)
- [L3 - Your_first_machine_learning_model.ipynb](./L3%20-%20Your_first_machine_learning_model.ipynb)

- [L7 - Machine_learning_competitions.ipynb](./L7%20-%20Machine_learning_competitions.ipynb)
- [House_price_prediction_v1.ipynb](./House_price_prediction_v1.ipynb)


### Conclusion:
Today I learned how models work - DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, overfitting & underfitting data and model validation using MAE. Also did house price prediction.
Actually I have done both Intro to ML and Intermediate ML course a year ago, but I forgot almost everything, so doing it again, now doing it seriously.
Not did Intermediate ML course today, rather did some house price prediction on things which I have learnt.
