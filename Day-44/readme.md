# Day 44 of [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/Param3021/status/1549295897414356992)
I have created a repository having all my notes and codes of Machine learning specialization course. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

## Task
1. Vectorization 
2. Gradient Descent for multiple linear regression

## Resources
- Machine Learning Specialization Course [ðŸ”—](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
- - Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification [ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### Topics I have learnt
1. Vectorization
2. Gradient Descent formula

### My notebooks
- All of my notes of this course are in my ML speicalization notes repository. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

### Conclusion:
Today I learned what is vectorization, how vectorization is faster than loop. Also, formula for gradient descent in multiple linear regression.
