# Day 45 of [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/Param3021/status/1549677064823140353)
I have created a repository having all my notes and codes of Machine learning specialization course. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

## Task
1. Feature Scaling
2. Checking gradient descent for convergence  (not done)

## Resources
- Machine Learning Specialization Course [ðŸ”—](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
- - Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification [ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### Topics I have learnt
1. Feature Scaling
- Max normalization
- Mean normalization
- Z-score normalization

### My notebooks
- All of my notes of this course are in my ML speicalization notes repository. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

### Conclusion:
Today I learned what is Feature Scaling, and why to do it. Also some feature scaling methods like dividing by max, mean normalization, Standardisation.
