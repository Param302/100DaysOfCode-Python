# Day 41 of [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/Param3021/status/1548234590695079936)
I have created a repository having all my notes and codes of Machine learning specialization course. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

## Task
1. Gradient Descent

## Resources
- Machine Learning Specialization Course [ðŸ”—](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
- - Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification [ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### Topics I have learnt
1. Gradient Descent
- What is gradient descent
- What is the use of gradient descent
- Working of gradient descent

### Software used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.10.2

### My notebooks
- All of my notes of this course are in my ML speicalization notes repository. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

### Conclusion:
Today I learned about what Gradient descent is and how it works.
It's really great, like finding best parameters for Cost function which makes it's value as minimum as possible.
