# Day 40 of [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/Param3021/status/1547887157993680896)
I have created a repository having all my notes and codes of Machine learning specialization course. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

## Task
1. Cost function
2. Gradient Descent   (not done)

## Resources
- Machine Learning Specialization Course [ðŸ”—](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
- - Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification [ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### Topics I have learnt
1. Cost function
- How cost function works
- How weights `w` and `b` effect linear regression model
- 2d/3d Contour plot (visualization of cost function)

### Software used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.10.2

### My notebooks
- All of my notes of this course are in my ML speicalization notes repository. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

### Conclusion:
Today I completed Regression model part in week 1, and learned about cost function, and how weights w and b effect the linear regression function. Also learned about 3d contour plot, it's ðŸ”¥.
