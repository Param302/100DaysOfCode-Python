# Day 48 of [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/Param3021/status/1550780252980654080)
I have created a repository having all my notes and codes of Machine learning specialization course. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

## Task
1. Linear Regression code with Gradient Descent in Python

## Resources
- Machine Learning Specialization Course [ðŸ”—](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
- - Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification [ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### Topics I have learnt
1. Ipmlemented Linear Regression code with Gradient Descent in Python (week 2 programming assignment)


### My notebooks
- All of my notes of this course are in my ML speicalization notes repository. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Param302/ML-specialization-notes)

### Conclusion:
Today I did programming assignment of linear regression and with this, Week 2 is completed ðŸ¥³.

So far, my pace is good!

Tomorrow, I will use all the things which I learned till now and make linear / polynomial regression model.
